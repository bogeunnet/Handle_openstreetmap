# Handle_openstreetmap
OpenStreetmap handling with python

Handle_openstreetmap_v2 is improved version and easy to use code style.

I recommend to use 2nd version of python code.

And if you want to get up/left and bottom/right position. please use 3rd version. (and bug fixed)

If you have any question and any suggestion to collaborate, please contace me.
